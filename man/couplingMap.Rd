\usage{
couplingMap(
  M,
  analysis = "documents",
  field = "CR",
  n = 500,
  label.term = NULL,
  impact.measure = "local",
  minfreq = 5,
  stemming = FALSE,
  size = 0.5,
  n.labels = 1,
  repel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{is a bibliographic dataframe.}

\item{analysis}{is the textual attribute used to select the unit of analysis. It can be \code{analysis = c("documents", "authors", "sources")}.}

\item{field}{is the textual attribute used to measure the coupling strength. It can be \code{field = c("CR", "ID","DE", "TI", "AB")}.}

\item{n}{is an integer. It indicates the number of units to include in the analysis.}

\item{label.term}{is a character. It indicates which content metadata have to use for cluster labeling. It can be \code{label.term = c("ID","DE","TI","AB")}.
If \code{label.term = NULL} cluster items will be use for labeling.}

\item{impact.measure}{is a character. It indicates the impact measure used to rank cluster elements (documents, authors or sources).
It can be \code{impact.measure = c("local", "global")}.\\
With \code{impact.measure = "local"}, \link{couplingMap} calculates elements impact using the Normalized Local Citation Score while 
using code{impact.measure = "global"}, the function uses the Normalized Global Citation Score to measure elements impact.}

\item{minfreq}{is a integer. It indicates the minimum frequency (per thousand) of a cluster. It is a number in the range (0,1000).}

\item{stemming}{is logical. If it is TRUE the word (from titles or abstracts) will be stemmed (using the Porter's algorithm).}

\item{size}{is numerical. It indicates the size of the cluster circles and is a number in the range (0.01,1).}

\item{n.labels}{is integer. It indicates how many labels associate to each cluster. Default is \code{n.labels = 1}.}

\item{repel}{is logical. If it is TRUE ggplot uses geom_label_repel instead of geom_label.}

\description{
It performs a coupling network analysis and plots community detection results on a bi-dimensional map (Coupling Map).
}
\details{
The analysis can be performed on three different units: documents, authors or sources and 
the coupling strength can be measured using the classical approach (coupled by references) 
or a novel approach based on unit contents (keywords or terms from titles and abstracts) 

The x-axis measures the cluster centrality (by Callon's Centrality index) while the y-axis measures the cluster impact 
by Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). 
The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is calculated 
by dividing the actual count of local citing items by the expected citation rate for documents with the same year of publication.
