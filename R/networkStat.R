#' Calculating network summary statistics
#'
#' \code{networkStat} calculates main network statistics.
#'
#' The function \code{\link{networkStat}} can calculate the main network statistics from a bibliographic network previously created by \code{\link{biblioNetwork}}.
#' @param object is a network matrix obtained by the function \code{\link{biblioNetwork}} or an graph object of the class \code{igraph}. 
#' @param stat is a character. It indicates which statistics are to be calculated. \code{stat = "network"} calculates the statistics related to the network; 
#' \code{stat = "all"} calculates the statistics related to the network and the individual nodes that compose it. Default value is \code{stat = "network"}.
#' @param type is a character. It indicates which centrality index is calculated. type values can be c("degree", "closeness", "betweenness","eigenvector","pagerank","hub","authority"). Default is "degree".
#' @return It is a list containing the following elements:
#' \tabular{lll}{
#' \code{graph} \tab  \tab a network object of the class \code{igraph}\cr
#' \code{network} \tab  \tab a \code{\link{communities}} a list with the main statistics of the network\cr
#' \code{vertex} \tab  \tab a data frame with the main measures of centrality and prestige of vertices.\cr}
